## Teacher's Lounge

## Problem Statement

 When exploring a more specific user group we could serve with this problem statement; teachers quickly came to mind. Further inquiry confirmed that teachers have an expressed need of connecting with other instructors and exchanging materials to further enhance the education experience of students.  

 ## Summary

 Throughout the interviews we conducted, educators expressed a common concern regarding the difficulty in giving and sharing experiences that have worked best in the classroom. Most tips/tricks teachers learn are passed along via word of mouth: while this works at some institutions, this decentralized method of communication limits widespread access to valuable resources that can improve the learning process of both teachers and students nationwide. 

The (Teacherâ€™s) Lounge aims to remediate this disconnect by creating a direct line of contact between educators. Through The Lounge, teachers can explore new content to implement at school, share advice on what experiences worked best for them, and find communities of teachers as an additional source of guidance.  

Currently, educators search for insight related to curriculum on a freemium platform TeachersPayTeachers and find some community support on hidden sub-Reddit threads and Facebook communities. Educators have expressed a desire for a platform that combines teacher comradery and resources. Our web app serves as the sole platform that provides both curriculum-based content and the opportunity to foster a community among teachers. the designed primarily for easy and equitable access to resources for all teachers in the education system. Instructors across the world now have a more streamlined method of obtaining and sharing information that can be of benefit in the classroom setting. 

## Customer Profile

Who: Instructors eager to share and learn tips/tips/advice to use in the classroom; for teachers eager to find a community of peers. 

What: Primarily professionals within the educational system (instructors, consultants, etc.) 

Where: Nationwide (possibly international) 

Why: Educators have rarely had a condensed site to share resources and community-building 

When: 25/8 

How: Normally communicate locally, via word of mouth. What you know is based on who you know  


## Goals



## Out of Scope

Scenario 1: Teachers able to video call one another on conference calls 

Scenario 2: Teachers having an optimize list of shareable content for students 

Scenario 3: Ability to mute words/profiles to prevent users from seeing irrelevant content 

Scenario 4: Ability to follow specific profiles to have user-curated feed 

Scenario 5: Ability to have a dynamic biography (sorta like what GitHub implemented)  

## Future Opportunities 

More advanced P implementations, adding features that were not included in the app. Adding features that were not implemented in early versions will allow our product to become more engaging and unique and increase the overall user-experience. 

Embedding ways in the app for data to be derived to measure the competitiveness and relative success of the app. This data will allow us to brainstorm ways to manage the success of the app, that is, to see the amount of time that the users are spending on the app overall as well as what features are used frequently as opposed to those that may be neglecting and how we could enhance individual features to increase their usage 

We want to add functionality that would allow teachers to have video calls with each other. This would be beneficial to teachers because video calling is more engaging than communication through texting. Non-verbal forms of communication play a huge role in how we effectively engage with each other and texting drastically decreases this. Video calling is also less time consuming than texting and allows for an overall richer experience using the app.  

Optimize the list of content that could be shared for students. Adding more information formats will allow the information exchanged to be more diverse. Diversity in sources is positive since it saves time by eliminating the need to convert the information to be uploaded to the platform into the limited number of formats that the platform currently allows. 

Ability to mute words / profiles to prevent users from seeing irrelevant content. Fine-tuning the information that the user interact with on the app will increase the value and dependency that the user places on it. It will save them time. Also, increasing the richness of the information (and the engagement) will also make them more likely to spend longer time periods in their usage 

Teachers could be given the ability to follow specific profiles so that they could have content more specific to their needs. This is directly related to the previously mentioned point. By limiting the number of profiles that the user views, they are given information more relevant to them which would increase their time spent on the app and thus give them a sense of dependency 

Option to make a dynamic biography. Allowing the user to make a dynamic biography gives them control over the information that they choose to share about themselves. Respecting the privacy of the user increases the favorability of the app since it will give them a sense of security while using our product. Giving them control over that feature also increases trust between the user and us
